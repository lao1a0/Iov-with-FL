abstract = {Growing deployment of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications is expected to significantly increase the volume of Basic Safety Messages (BSM) in highways and dense roads. Computational overhead of verifying the integrity of BSMs will therefore be high while current V2V equipment can process only a limited number of BSMs per second. As a result, critical BSMs carrying vital information may fail to be processed on time, creating unsafe outcomes. In this paper, we expose this vulnerability, discuss critical scenarios, develop novel attacks that exploit this vulnerability, and propose a sieving technique to mitigate these verification gridlock attacks. We show on a USRP testbed that our proposed sieving mechanism to counter sophisticated attackers who exploit this vulnerability achieves 80% accuracy at SNR greater than 6 dB, effectively mitigating the attack.},

abstract = {Exchanging gradients is a widely used method in modern multi-node machine learning system (e.g., distributed training, collaborative learning). For a long time, people believed that gradients are safe to share: i.e., the training data will not be leaked by gradients exchange. However, we show that it is possible to obtain the private training data from the publicly shared gradients. We name this leakage as Deep Leakage from Gradient and empirically validate the effectiveness on both computer vision and natural language processing tasks. Experimental results show that our attack is much stronger than previous approaches: the recovery is pixel-wise accurate for images and token-wise matching for texts. Thereby we want to raise people's awareness to rethink the gradient's safety. We also discuss several possible strategies to prevent such deep leakage. The most effective defense method is gradient pruning.},
